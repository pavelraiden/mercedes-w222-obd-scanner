## 3. Core Components

### 3.1. Backend API (FastAPI)

The backend is a secure, high-performance FastAPI application that serves as the central nervous system of the project. It provides:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and session management using JWT tokens.
- **User & Device Management:** Endpoints for managing user profiles, subscriptions, and registered devices.
- **Payment Integration:** Full integration with Stripe for subscription management and payments.
- **Data Processing:** Real-time processing of OBD data received from Raspberry Pi clients via a secure WebSocket gateway.
- **AI & ML Integration:** Orchestrates calls to the Claude API for trip analysis and manages the local machine learning model for anomaly detection.

### 3.2. Frontend (React)

The frontend is a modern, responsive web application built with React and the shadcn/ui component library. It provides a user-friendly interface for:

- **Real-time Dashboard:** Visualization of real-time vehicle data, including engine RPM, speed, and coolant temperature.
- **Trip History:** Analysis of past trips with AI-powered insights and recommendations.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Display of predictive maintenance alerts and component wear indices.
- **User Account Management:** Interface for managing user profiles, subscriptions, and payment methods.

### 3.3. Raspberry Pi Client & Tamagotchi Display

The Raspberry Pi client is a Python application responsible for collecting data from the vehicle's OBD-II port. Its key features include:

- **OBD-II & UDS Protocol Support:** Flexible architecture for communicating with various vehicle protocols.
- **Real-time Data Streaming:** Secure WebSocket connection for real-time data transmission to the backend.
- **Tamagotchi Interface:** An interactive display that provides a 

gamified view of the vehicle's health, encouraging proactive maintenance.
- **Offline Caching:** Local caching of data in case of network interruptions, with automatic synchronization upon reconnection.

## 4. Security Hardening

Security is a top priority, and a multi-layered approach has been implemented to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

### 4.1. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** All authenticated endpoints are protected using JWTs with short expiration times and refresh token rotation.
- **Secure Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with a unique salt for each user, making them resilient to brute-force attacks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system supports different user roles (e.g., user, admin) with granular permissions.

### 4.2. API & Application Security

- **Input Validation:** All user inputs are strictly validated using Pydantic models to prevent injection attacks.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** The data access layer uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Path Traversal Protection:** The backup and restore system includes validation to prevent path traversal attacks when handling archives.
- **Security Headers:** The API responds with a comprehensive set of security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### 4.3. Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security:** Containers are run with non-root users, and images are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** All communication between the client, API, and other services is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **Secret Management:** Sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials are managed through environment variables and are not hardcoded in the source code.

## 5. AI & Machine Learning System

The system includes a sophisticated AI and machine learning architecture for providing advanced diagnostics and predictive maintenance.

### 5.1. AI-Powered Diagnostics (Claude API)

For in-depth trip analysis and diagnostic reports, the system leverages the **Anthropic Claude API**. Optimized prompts are sent to Claude with anonymized trip data to generate human-readable insights, fuel efficiency recommendations, and potential maintenance advice.

### 5.2. Self-Learning Anomaly Detection

A local machine learning model, based on Scikit-learn, is used for real-time anomaly detection. This model is designed to be self-learning:

1.  **Initial Training:** The model is initially trained on a baseline dataset of normal vehicle operation.
2.  **Real-time Inference:** It analyzes incoming OBD data in real-time to detect deviations from normal patterns.
3.  **Feedback Loop:** When a user confirms or dismisses an anomaly alert, this feedback is stored in the database.
4.  **Periodic Retraining:** A scheduled MLOps process periodically retrains the model using the latest data and user feedback, allowing it to adapt to the specific vehicle's characteristics and improve its accuracy over time.

## 6. Deployment & Operations

### 6.1. CI/CD Pipeline

An automated CI/CD pipeline is set up using **GitHub Actions** to ensure consistent and reliable deployments. The pipeline includes stages for code quality checks, security scanning, automated testing, and Docker image building.

### 6.2. Monitoring & Alerting

- **Prometheus:** Collects a wide range of metrics from the application and system.
- **Grafana:** Provides a flexible dashboard for visualizing metrics and creating custom alerts for issues such as high CPU usage or API error rates.

### 6.3. Backup & Disaster Recovery

The system includes a robust backup and disaster recovery system that provides:
- **Automated Backups:** Scheduled backups of both the PostgreSQL database and critical file system data.
- **Secure Restoration:** A security-hardened restoration process that protects against common vulnerabilities.
- **Cloud Integration:** Support for storing backups in cloud storage services like AWS S3 for added redundancy.

## 7. Conclusion
