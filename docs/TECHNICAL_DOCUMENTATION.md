## 3. Core Components

### 3.1. Backend API (FastAPI)

The backend is a secure, high-performance FastAPI application that serves as the core of the system. It provides the following functionalities:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and session management using JWT tokens.
- **User & Device Management:** Endpoints for managing user profiles, subscriptions, and registered devices.
- **Data Processing:** Real-time processing of OBD data received from Raspberry Pi clients.
- **AI & ML Integration:** Integration with AI services (Claude API) for trip analysis and a local machine learning model for anomaly detection.
- **Database Interaction:** Secure and efficient interaction with the PostgreSQL database through a dedicated database manager.

### 3.2. Frontend (React)

The frontend is a modern, responsive web application built with React. It provides a user-friendly interface for:

- **Real-time Dashboard:** Visualization of real-time vehicle data, including engine RPM, speed, and coolant temperature.
- **Trip History:** Analysis of past trips with AI-powered insights and recommendations.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Display of predictive maintenance alerts and component wear indices.
- **User Account Management:** Interface for managing user profiles, subscriptions, and payment methods.

### 3.3. Raspberry Pi Client

The Raspberry Pi client is a Python application responsible for collecting data from the vehicle's OBD-II port. Its key features include:

- **OBD-II & UDS Protocol Support:** Flexible architecture for communicating with various vehicle protocols.
- **Real-time Data Streaming:** Secure WebSocket connection for real-time data transmission to the backend.
- **Offline Caching:** Local caching of data in case of network interruptions, with automatic synchronization upon reconnection.
- **Secure Device Authentication:** Each device is authenticated with a unique token to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Security Hardening

Security is a critical aspect of the system. A multi-layered approach has been implemented to protect against common vulnerabilities.

### 4.1. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** All authenticated endpoints are protected using JWTs with a short expiration time.
- **Secure Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with a unique salt for each user.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system is designed to support different user roles (e.g., user, admin) with varying levels of access.

### 4.2. API Security

- **Rate Limiting:** Endpoints are protected against brute-force attacks with rate limiting based on IP address and user ID.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** All user inputs are strictly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks.
- **Security Headers:** The API responds with a comprehensive set of security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **CSRF Protection:** The system includes CSRF token generation and validation for all state-changing requests.

### 4.3. Infrastructure Security

- **Docker Security:** Containers are run with non-root users, and images are scanned for vulnerabilities using Trivy.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** All communication between the client, API, and other services is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- **Environment-based Configuration:** Sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials are managed through environment variables, not hardcoded in the source code.

## 5. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting

A comprehensive monitoring and logging system is in place to ensure high availability and quick issue resolution.

### 5.1. Monitoring

- **Prometheus:** Collects a wide range of metrics from the application and system, including CPU/memory usage, API response times, and error rates.
- **Grafana:** Provides a flexible dashboard for visualizing metrics and creating custom alerts.

### 5.2. Logging

- **Structured Logging:** All logs are generated in a structured JSON format for easy parsing and analysis.
- **Centralized Logging:** Logs from all components are collected and stored in a centralized location.
- **Log Levels:** Different log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) are used to categorize events and facilitate filtering.

### 5.3. Alerting

- **Alertmanager:** Manages alerts generated by Prometheus and sends notifications through various channels (e.g., email, Slack).
- **Pre-configured Alerts:** A set of pre-configured alerts is in place for common issues such as high CPU usage, low disk space, and high error rates.

## 6. CI/CD and Deployment

An automated CI/CD pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions to ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

### 6.1. CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Code Quality & Security:** Runs linters, formatters, and security scanners on every push and pull request.
2. **Testing:** Executes a comprehensive suite of unit, integration, and performance tests.
3. **Docker Build:** Builds and tests the Docker image for the application.
4. **Deployment:** Deploys the application to staging and production environments based on the branch and event type.

### 6.2. Deployment Automation

A Python-based deployment script (`scripts/deploy.py`) automates the deployment process, including:
- **Database Backups & Migrations:** Automatically creates database backups and runs migrations before deployment.
- **Health Checks:** Performs health checks after deployment to ensure the application is running correctly.
- **Rollback on Failure:** Automatically rolls back to the previous version in case of a deployment failure.

## 7. Conclusion

The Mercedes W222 OBD Scanner is a robust, secure, and scalable system designed for commercial use. This document provides a detailed overview of its technical implementation, which should serve as a valuable resource for developers and administrators.
