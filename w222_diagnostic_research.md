**Common Causes:**
- Worn valve bodies
- Contaminated transmission fluid
- Faulty solenoids
- Internal clutch wear

**Diagnostic Parameters:**
- Transmission fluid temperature: Normal 60-120°C
- Hydraulic pressure readings
- Gear position sensor data
- Torque converter lock-up status

## Air Suspension System (AIRMATIC)

### Air Strut Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Sagging suspension
- Uneven ride height
- Warning messages on dashboard
- Compressor working overtime

**Common Causes:**
- Rubber component deterioration
- Air leaks in struts
- Valve block failures

**Diagnostic Parameters:**
- Air pressure in each strut: Normal 8-16 bar
- Ride height sensors: Normal ±20mm variance
- Compressor duty cycle
- Valve block operation

### Compressor Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Complete suspension collapse
- Excessive compressor noise
- Overheating warnings

**Common Causes:**
- Overuse due to air leaks
- Electrical faults
- Internal wear

**Diagnostic Parameters:**
- Compressor current draw: Normal 15-25A
- Operating temperature
- Pressure buildup rate
- Relay operation status

## Electrical System Issues

### Command System Malfunctions
**Symptoms:**
- Infotainment system freezing
- Navigation errors
- Audio system failures
- Climate control issues

**Common Causes:**
- Software bugs
- Hardware component failures
- Wiring harness issues
- CAN bus communication errors

**Diagnostic Parameters:**
- CAN bus communication status
- Module response times
- Error code frequencies
- Power supply voltages

## Critical Diagnostic Patterns for ML Model

### High-Risk Combinations:
1. **Engine Overheating + Oil Pressure Drop + Turbo Noise** = Imminent engine failure
2. **Transmission Rough Shifting + High Fluid Temperature + Pressure Loss** = Transmission rebuild needed
3. **Multiple Air Strut Pressure Loss + Compressor Overwork** = Complete AIRMATIC system failure
4. **Coolant Loss + Temperature Fluctuation + Fan Overrun** = Cooling system cascade failure

### Predictive Indicators:
- Oil temperature consistently >130°C = Turbo failure risk
- Transmission fluid temp >140°C = Internal damage risk
- Air strut pressure variance >30% = Strut replacement needed
- Compressor duty cycle >60% = Compressor failure imminent

### Maintenance Triggers:
- Oil change interval: Every 10,000km or 12 months
- Transmission service: Every 60,000km
- Coolant flush: Every 40,000km
- Air suspension inspection: Every 20,000km
